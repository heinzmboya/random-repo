yes, this is Mboya.

The Lord Jesus is my personal saviour. If you haven't made Him your saviour, pray you may not run out of time and have it too late on your side.
No human is perfect. We've lied, we've gossiped, we've been adulterers and worshipped idols, lusted and covet. Yahweh is just and must punish every offense. So Jesus took the punishment in our place as He has always loved us with an everlasting love. Brethren we have no otherwise. We need Him.
